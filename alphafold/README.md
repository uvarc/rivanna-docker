# AlphaFold

https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold

## Notes on Dockerfile
On disk the image size is 5.4 GB, 47% smaller than that built from the official Dockerfile (10.1 GB).

Major differences:
- No need to have system CUDA libraries (all in conda env)
- Use micromamba as base image for build stage
- Three-stage build process to eliminate buildtime dependencies
