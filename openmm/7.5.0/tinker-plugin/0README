                    Files for OpenMM-Enabled TINKER DYNAMIC
                    ---------------------------------------

          This directory contains the files needed to build a TINKER
          DYNAMIC program using the GPU-capable OpenMM libraries. The
          files should be copied into the /source directory of a clean
          distribution of TINKER 7.1.2. The Makefile provided here can
          then be used, after minor editing, to build a dynamic_omm.x
          executable. The Makefile assumes OpenMM 6.2.0 is present in
          its default location, /usr/local/openmm. NVIDIA CUDA must
          also be installed on the target machine, and a CUDA-capable
          graphics card is required.
